                                    Setup

Prerequisites:
- Web server with PHP5 support
- MySQL server (version >= 5.0)

Copy the file php/config.inc.php5.template to php/config.inc.php5, and enter the
connection info for your MySQL server in this new file. Make sure you also set
proper permissions on this file so that nobody can read your plain text password.
Then import db/structure.sql in your server's database (using phpmyadmin for
instance). It's ready! Just open index.php5 in a browser. Contact me for
troubleshooting.

NB: this code relies on magic_quotes_gpc set to "On" in php.ini. It's now
deprecated with PHP 5.3.0 and set to "Off" by default ; make sure use set it back
to "On" or you'll get trouble with single quotes and other stuff.
