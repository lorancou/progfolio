Progfolio
================================================================================

This is a basic Markdown-based website engine for creating programmer
portfolios and such. It just reads .md files from the filesystem and creates web
pages with them. No need to bother with databases or user accounts or comments
or Javascript frameworks. Just edit good old text files and feel the magic.

Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Copy all files in a fully configured web server with PHP support
- Rename php/config.php.template → php/config.php
- Fill it with your info
- I guess that's it: try opening index.php in you browser
- Try adding new .md files in the content folder
- Refresh the web page
